# Kaggle Competitions

Here you will find various competitions I have competed in to gain experience. With many competitions, extensive data analysis and feature engineering is required to place high on the leaderboard, but the focus of these projects is developing architectures that are conducive to training. For a few different projects, I've used multiple architectures for one submission, measuring how well one does versus the other.
